UNIT 4 LAB: INTERACTIVE FEATURES

For this week's lab, we were tasked to implmenet some interactive features into our website. Rather than focus on making edits to the entire site, I thought it would be more suitable to modify individual features in different sections of my website. Though some content is now no longer as accessible as before due to the implementation of JavaScript, I do hope that some of these edits have enhanced the overall experience of the website. 

1. Enhanced Photos

As per the instructions of the lab, I decided to make one my features images that could show their captions and be enlargened. Hovering above them should allow for a short caption to appear underneath, and click on them once will enlargen them to a slightly bigger size. You can click again to make it return to the normal size. 

2. Toggling Quest Tabs

The other interactive experience implemented was the quest tabs, which can be found on the Side Quests portion of the Act One page. In this edit, I changed it so that users wouldn't have to scroll and would instead be able to toggle between the different sections. Each section appears as a new element/division, replacing the older one in its original position.

Because these edits took me a majority of the week, I was unfortunately unable to update the images on the site to be of higher quality. I will focus on implementing those smaller edits when I have time over the weekend. 

CITATIONS

For this lab, I consulted ChatGPT for some advice and guidance on how to implement some of the more complex parts of my code. ChatGPT helped me on debug issues with onclick, mouseover, mouseout, and the usage of innerHTML/outerHTML.
